Key Points:
- McLaren is firmly in the lead despite recent successes by Max Verstappen / Red Bull Racing and steady point gains by Ferrari and Mercedes.
- Due to Isack Hadjar's / Racing Bulls' recent podium and Aston Martin's slim 1-point lead, there will definitely be a battle for 6th.
- The only other change this point in the season could be between the Kick Sauber and Haas F1 Team for 8th.

Key Points:
- The point gaps between the top 4 teams are too large (20+) to cause much change at this stage in the 2025 season.
- There may be some movement in the mid- and low-ranking positions between Aston Martin and Racing Bulls and even between Kick Sauber and Haas F1 Team.
- Unless McLaren doesn't lock down the top spot in the World Constructor's Championship, there *could* be an opportunity for Ferrari to winâ€”but this is unlikely given the statistics this year.
