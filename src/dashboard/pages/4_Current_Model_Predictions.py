Key Points:
- Since there are only 6 races remaining, the models are predicting less movement from the current positions.
- Of course, given the tie between Aston Martin and Racing Bulls, the models present some disagreement over who will take 6th place. However, Racing Bulls seem to have an edge given their season-long performance.

Key Points:
- After McLaren, Mercedes is strongly predicted to take 2nd place with only one model suggesting Ferrari could make a comeback.
- Since the gap for 3rd is so small, the models are displaying disagreement over which team will earn this spot. Given Max Verstappen / Red Bull Racing's recent string of podiums and wins and Ferrari's decline in performance, Red Bull Racing is favored to triumph.
- As seen in other ensemble predictions, there is a battle for 6th, but Racing Bulls seems to have an edge over Aston Martin and other teams given their overall performance this season.
- Finally, since Kick Sauber's form has been declining and Haas F1 Team's form has been steadily rising, the models are suggesting there is a chance for the Haas F1 Team to steal 8th place from Kick Sauber.

st.markdown('''
Key Points:
- Mercedes is generally predicted to take 2nd place, but two of the less accurate models suggest Ferrari could make a comeback since the gap isn't too large.
- Despite what the Tifosi-biased models say, a majority of the models think Red Bull Racing could even top Ferrari for 3rd.
- Midfield battles are heating up. While a majority of the models are in agreement that Williams will hold onto their 5th place, some are suggesting a sudden drop in performance, given recent race results, leaving the door open for other teams.
- The v1 models are not as accurate in predicting lower ranked teams, but the general consensus is that Kick Sauber, Haas F1 Team, and Alpine are on the bottom.
