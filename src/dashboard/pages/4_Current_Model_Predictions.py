Key Points:
- McLaren is still firmly in the lead despite the recent stream of wins by Max Verstappen / Red Bull Racing and steady point gains by Ferrari and Mercedes.
- Given the latest momentum by Mercedes, they have taken a narrow lead over Ferrari and are generally predicted to maintain this position.
- Due to Racing Bulls' excellent qualifying and race performance in Baku, they have surged past Aston Martin for 6th position.

Key Points:
- There will be a fight for 2nd due to the recent victories by Max Verstappen / Red Bull Racing and improvement in form by Mercedes. Although Ferrari has built up a lead throughout the season, their recent performances haven't been able to match Red Bull Racing or Mercedes, which may cost them the position. The front-runners for 2nd position are Ferrari and Mercedes.
- The gap between Racing Bulls and Aston Martin is still narrow, but the models generally agree that Racing Bulls will triumph.
- Finally, since Kick Sauber's form has been declining and Haas F1 Team's form has been steadily rising, the models are suggesting there is a chance for the Haas F1 Team to steal 8th place from Kick Sauber.

Key Points:
- McLaren is still firmly in the lead despite recent successes by Max Verstappen / Red Bull Racing and steady point gains by Ferrari and Mercedes.
- Despite the recent race and updated Constructors' Championship standings, the models think that Ferrari will take back 2nd place and that Red Bull Racing will also have a significant opportunity to even take 3rd place from Mercedes.
- As the season enters the final 7 races, there will be significant changes for the last 5 teams, especially given how small the gaps in points are. In general, Williams and Aston Martin sit comfortably in 5th and 7th positions respectively. Either Kick Sauber or Racing Bulls would take 6th. Finally, this ensemble of models believe the last three teams will be Haas F1 Team, either Kick Sauber or Racing Bulls, and Alpine in that order.
