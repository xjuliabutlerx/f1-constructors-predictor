st.write("This project contains 3 generations of machine learning ranking models used to predict Formula 1 Constructor's Championship standings.")

st.markdown("""
What these models can do:
- Help explain which teams are on the rise or decline based on recent form, driver consistency, and reliability
- Use past races to predict how teams will perform across the season
- Show how standings could evolve as the season continues
""")

st.markdown("""
The results of this project:
- Highlight how important reliability and consistency are
- Lets fans and analysts compare different prediction strategies
- Can be used regardless of how many teams are current in Formula 1 (meaning, the models from this project can be used immediately for the 2026 season when there will be 11 teams)

st.markdown("""
- v1: a set of models that react strongly to recent races and performances
- v2: a set of models that focuses more on historical and long-term performance rather than recent events
- v3: a set of models that balances the approaches of v1 and v2 models, balancing consistency with recent form
